# Basic Coding

### 1st programming language:

C++ or Python... 
Your call... 

I would recommend C++ to be the first language and then in time when you get familiar with coding concepts and all, you will have to move to python. (Everything today uses python but learning it as the first language may not be the best move... so lets move slow and steady and learn c++ first... then in time, learn python)

A good grasp on python can land you a good job... (I didn't know its importance and started it late but most work i have to do from now on is in python only)
Most of the research work is also done in python so its good if you want to publish papers and all.

Summary: Python to karni hi hai... but build the coding basics before that so that its easy to grasp.

### Where to learn it from?
https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp
One of the best resources...
Slowly go through every concept in order and you have to go till the topic C++ Arrays for now.
And till C++ Recursion in the long run (not needed too much as a beginner but needed after a certain extent)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKDvMcJiEPM watch this after doing it... (one single concept of vectors which is important)
Future tip: use vectors instead of arrays.

Don't jump into the concept of calsses in C++ as of now as it will only make things complicated...

### Where to practice from?

Once this is complete, you now need to apply what you learnt. So we'll start writing programs and doing practice and for that we will use codechef.

https://www.codechef.com/practice

Start with difficulty level 200 and for every problem you are able to solve (in < 30 mins) try a question with difficulty 50 more than previous... if stuck, try nearby level problems and view solutions. 5-6 problems per week is enough... after that your wish...

#### Will keep on updating this readme file...
